            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology at Cebu Technological University (CTU), where I am gaining comprehensive knowledge and skills essential for a successful career in the tech industry.<br>
                My journey in education began with my completion of secondary education at Dalaguete Central Elementary School in the school year 2006-2007, where I graduated with High Honors.<br>
                This early academic achievement ignited my passion for learning and set a strong foundation for my future studies.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Following this, I continued my academic journey at Dalaguete National High School, where I completed my secondary education in the school year 2019-2023, once again graduating with High Honors.<br>
                Throughout my high school years, I actively engaged in various extracurricular activities and leadership roles, which further developed my skills and deepened my commitment to academic excellence.<br><br>
                Now, at CTU, I am excited to explore innovative technologies and participate in projects that will allow me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, ultimately preparing me to make meaningful contributions to the field of technology.
